            <h1>Packing in code golf</h1>
            <p>
                Say you wanted, for <a href="https://code.golf/ascii-table#python">some reason</a>,
                to print the following string in the shortest code:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-plaintext">   2 3 4 5 6 7
 -------------
0:   0 @ P ` p
1: ! 1 A Q a q
2: " 2 B R b r
3: # 3 C S c s
4: $ 4 D T d t
5: % 5 E U e u
6: & 6 F V f v
7: ' 7 G W g w
8: ( 8 H X h x
9: ) 9 I Y i y
A: * : J Z j z
B: + ; K [ k {
C: , &lt; L \ l |
D: - = M ] m }
E: . > N ^ n ~
F: / ? O _ o DEL
</code></pre>
            <p>
                Obviously, you could just strick that into a multiline string and print it directly
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-python">print("""   2 3 4 5 6 7
...
F: / ? O _ o DEL""")</code></pre>
            <p>But surely there has to be a better way?</p>
            <p>
                Well, one way that you could be more efficient is through the use of packing.
                Packing is the art abusing character counts by using
                <strong>unicode characters</strong> or other compression techniques.
            </p>
            <h2>UTF-16</h2>
            <p>
                Unicode characters are counted as a single character, but may be composed of many
                bytes. For example, this: <code>"ðŸ˜€"</code> is a single character (you can verify
                this by running <code>print(len("ðŸ˜€"))</code>). However, it stores more than one
                byte:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-python">
print("ðŸ˜€".encode("utf-8") == b'\xf0\x9f\x98\x80')
        </code></pre>
            <p>
                One common python packer is the following: (taken from the
                <a href="https://code.golf/wiki/langs/python">code.golf wiki</a>
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-python">print('CODE'.encode().decode('u16'))</code></pre>
            <p>
                First, it takes some code, and encodes it as <code>utf-8</code>, the default. UTF-8
                stores the code points and stores them as bytes. These bytes don't have an encoding:
                they're just a list of integers. So then, we interpret these bytes as UTF-16, which
                takes pairs of two bytes and interprets them as a single character. (This also has
                the side effect of requiring that the number of bytes in our program be divisible by
                2). Thus, we just used twice as less characters!
            </p>
            <p>Decoding this is just as simple:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-python">exec(bytes('...','u16')[2:]) # for executing
'...'.encode("u16")[2:].decode() # for using as a string</code></pre>
            <p>
                We take our unicode string, decode it as UTF-16, remove the two bytes, and execute
                the code. The reason for skipping the first two bytes is that python inserts a
                two-byte
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark">byte order mark</a> that we
                must skip.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason that we cannot use UTF-32 is that the resulting code points from grouping
                4 characters is too large.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using this method, our original text is packed into just 136 chars, exactly half of
                the original!
