            <h1>Packing in code golf</h1>
            <p>
                Say you wanted, for <a href="https://code.golf/ascii-table#python">some reason</a>,
                to print the following string in the shortest code:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-plaintext">   2 3 4 5 6 7
 -------------
0:   0 @ P ` p
1: ! 1 A Q a q
2: " 2 B R b r
3: # 3 C S c s
4: $ 4 D T d t
5: % 5 E U e u
6: & 6 F V f v
7: ' 7 G W g w
8: ( 8 H X h x
9: ) 9 I Y i y
A: * : J Z j z
B: + ; K [ k {
C: , &lt; L \ l |
D: - = M ] m }
E: . > N ^ n ~
F: / ? O _ o DEL
</code></pre>
            <p>
                Obviously, you could just strick that into a multiline string and print it directly
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-python">print("""   2 3 4 5 6 7
...
F: / ? O _ o DEL""")</code></pre>
            <p>
                One way that you could do that in less space is through the use of packing. Packing
                is the art abusing character counts by using
                <strong>unicode characters</strong> or other compression techniques.
            </p>
            <h2>UTF-16</h2>
            <p>
                Unicode characters that are counted as a single character may be composed of many
                bytes. For example, this emoji <code>"ðŸ˜€"</code> is a single character (you can
                verify this by running <code>print(len("ðŸ˜€"))</code>). However, in UTF-8 it is 4
                bytes long!
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-python">
print("ðŸ˜€".encode("utf-8") == b'\xf0\x9f\x98\x80')
        </code></pre>
            <p>
                One common python packer is the following: (taken from the
                <a href="https://code.golf/wiki/langs/python">code.golf wiki</a>
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-python">print('CODE'.encode().decode('u16'))</code></pre>
            <p>
                First, it takes a string, and converts it to bytes according to the (default)
                <code>utf-8</code> encoding. Then, we reinterpret those bytes as UTF-16, which takes
                pairs of two bytes and interprets them as a single code point. (This also has the
                side effect of requiring that the number of bytes in our program be divisible by 2).
                Thus, we just used twice as less characters!
            </p>
            <p>Decoding this is just as simple:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-python">exec(bytes('...','u16')[2:]) # for executing
'...'.encode("u16")[2:].decode() # for using as a string</code></pre>
            <p>
                We take our unicode string, convert it to bytes according to UTF-16, remove the
                first two characters, and execute the code. The reason for skipping the first two
                bytes is that python inserts a two-byte
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark">byte order mark</a> that we
                must skip.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason that we cannot use UTF-32 is that the resulting code points from grouping
                4 characters is too large.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using this method, our original text is packed into just 136 chars, exactly half of
                the original!
