First, run `npm install`

then, `cd` into `fractal-wasm`

Install [wasm pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/).
Then, build the wasm with `wasm-pack build`.
All done with wasm! Now you can cd back into the root.

To build, run `npm run build`. If you're editing some code, you can build with watch using `npm run build:watch`.

Now, you can either visit the site through local files (untested), or I use the live server VSCode extension.
